# ML Lab — Shresth Panigrahi

This repository is my Machine Learning lab: a place to learn, experiment, and contribute to ML projects, exercises, and analyses.

**Overview**
- **Purpose:** Hands-on learning and small projects to build practical ML skills.
- **Focus areas:** supervised & unsupervised learning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and applied projects using real datasets.

**Contents**
- `USA_Housing.csv` — sample dataset for experiments and demonstrations.
- Notebooks, scripts, and notes will be added under descriptive folders as the lab grows.

**Goals**
- Learn core ML concepts and algorithms.
- Build small end-to-end projects and experiments.
- Keep reproducible notebooks and clear documentation.
- Share results and welcome contributions.

**Getting Started**
1. Install Python (3.8+ recommended) and create a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` is added):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open Jupyter notebooks or run scripts:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

**Usage**
- Add notebooks under a `notebooks/` folder and scripts under `src/`.
- Document experiments in Markdown cells and keep data in a `data/` folder (avoid committing large raw datasets).

**Contributing**
- Feel free to add experiments, notebooks, and helpful scripts.
- Open issues or pull requests with a clear description of changes.

**License**
- This repository is for learning. Add a license file when you choose one.

Happy learning — start small, iterate often, and document what you learn.
